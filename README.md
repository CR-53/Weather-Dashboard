## Task Description

The assignment for this week was to create a weather dashboard that took in a user's searched city and displayed current and future weather information on the screen provided by OpenWeatherMap's APIs. A history list of previous searches also had to be created and when an item in the history was clicked on, it had to perform the same function as if the item were searched. All persistent data had to be stored in local storage and the last searched city's weather information had to be loaded from local storage after closing and opening the page.
